abstract = {User Acceptance Testing (UAT) aims to determine whether or not a software satisfies users acceptance criteria. Although some studies have used acceptance tests as software requirements, no previous study has collected information about available UAT techniques and established a comparison of them, to support an organization in the selection of one over another. This work presents a Systematic Literature Review on UAT to find out available techniques and compare their main features. We selected 80 studies and found out 21 UAT techniques. As result, we created a comparative table summarizing these techniques and their features.},
